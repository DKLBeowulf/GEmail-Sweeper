# GEmail-Sweeper
A python program that lets you delete gmail emails from a CLI.

To use you have to edit the python file and fill in the user email address and password .  The password in most
email providers can be found in a third party option that you will have to get from your email provider usually in the
settings where you can allow third party apps.

The 'target' is just a keyword or email i.e. 'Robert' or robert@robert.com.
If the target cannot be achieved then it will close the program.
